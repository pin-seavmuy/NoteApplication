A simple and responsive notes app built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS on the front-end, and ASP.NET Core Web API with SQL Server on the back-end. Users can create, read, update, and delete personal notes with real-time search and filtering. The app tracks note creation and update timestamps and ensures data privacy by allowing users to manage only their own notes. API calls are handled with Axios, and the backend uses Dapper ORM for efficient database operations.
